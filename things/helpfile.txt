---------- HELP FILE ----------

This game is a parody of text based adventure games. That said, you will
have to figure out most of the commands yourself (because some of them
are just jokes), but here are some basic commands to get you started:

n, s, w, e, u, d - Directional commands, pretty standard amongst text
                   based adventure games. The letters are abbreviations
		   of north, south, west, east, up and down.

save, load - Saves/restores your progress. You have five save files to
             save to/load from.

open, take, lift, read, kill, eat - Also common in text based adventure
                                    games. Pretty much self explanatory.
                                    Please note that you cannot type for
				    example "take key(enter)", you have
				    to type "take(enter)key(enter)".

look, whoami, whereami, whenami - Provides information about what you can
                                  see/who you are/where you are/what time
                                  it is.

exit - Quits the game. Make sure to save first!

viewthehelpfileplz - Displays this file.

Good luck!
